[rand.js](https://randjs.com) is a lightweight seeded pseudorandom number generator. 

Currently, this library uses a [linear congruential generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator), but looks to incorporate the [PCG Family](http://www.pcg-random.org) of generators in the future.

To use download the file [rand.min.js](lib/rand.min.js)
